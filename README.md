# *Why MentalWellness?*
*"NO HEALTH WITHOUT MENTAL HEALTH"*
According to studies, most of the Mental health cases goes unnoticed by the sufferers. Hence, understanding your position on the mental health spectrum can help you be more aware and take timely proactive steps. There is also a huge gap between the mental health services and the stakeholders.
At MentalWellness, we believe in the importance of mental health care as much as physical health.
This is our small approach to address these and here we've tried to bring together a bunch of features through our platform and offer comprehensive resources and support to help individuals prioritize their mental well-being, access valuable resources, and find the support needed for a healthier, happier life.
